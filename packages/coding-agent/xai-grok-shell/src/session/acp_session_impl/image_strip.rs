//! Shell policy for sampler image strips: which strips may rewrite stored
//! history, when, and what the user is told.
//!
//! - Only `ServerRejected` with unambiguous blame (exactly one unique URL
//!   in the rejected request) may touch history; the server's verdict
//!   names the request, not an image.
//! - The rewrite is deferred until that request's `Completed` proves the
//!   strip helped; `Failed` drops the buffer.
//! - The write is backup-gated and disk-acknowledged ([`StripOutcome`]);
//!   only `Applied` claims the stored conversation changed.
//! - Scope: `chat_history.jsonl` only. A rebuild replaying `updates.jsonl`
//!   (e.g. a remote pull) restores the image and pays one more strip cycle.
