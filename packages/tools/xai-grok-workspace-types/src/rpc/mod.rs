//! Canonical wire types for hub-proxied `workspace.*` RPC methods.
//! They are shared by the server (hub_server), the shell proxy client (`WorkspaceOps`), and clients that cannot depend on `xai-grok-workspace`.
//! Types not yet migrated here live next to their `WorkspaceOp` impls in that crate; each type has exactly one [`WorkspaceRpc`] impl.
//! [`RpcError`]-code-to-error-enum mapping is deliberately not defined here.
