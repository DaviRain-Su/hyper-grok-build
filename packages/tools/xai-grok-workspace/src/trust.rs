//! Folder-trust store ("do you trust this folder?").
//!
//! Persists per-folder trust decisions to `~/.grok/trusted_folders.toml`.
//! This is the durable backing store for the VS-Code-style folder-trust gate
//! that decides whether repo-local MCP / LSP servers (which run arbitrary
//! commands from repo-controlled config files) are allowed to spawn.
//!
//! TOML shape:
//! ```toml
//! [folders."/abs/repo/root"]
//! trusted = true
//! decided_at = 1780000000
//! ```
//!
//! A recorded grant covers that workspace key and descendants that still
//! resolve to the same git root ([`workspace_key`]). A nearer recorded
//! decision wins. Other workspace keys under the path — including nested git
//! roots — are not covered. The persisted file is written atomically with
//! owner-only (`0600`) permissions.
//!
//! The store is rooted at [`xai_grok_config::user_grok_home`] — the **Option**
//! home that resolves to `None` (rather than a cwd-relative `./.grok`) when
//! neither `$GROK_HOME` nor a home directory is set (e.g. a minimal container /
//! CI). In that no-home environment [`TrustStore::load`] yields an **empty,
//! trust-nothing** store that persists nothing, so a cloned repo can never ship
//! a `./.grok/trusted_folders.toml` that self-trusts its own checkout (fail
//! closed).
