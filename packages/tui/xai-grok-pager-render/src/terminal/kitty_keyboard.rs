//! Which Kitty keyboard enhancement flags the pager negotiates at startup, and
//! the process-global record of the set it actually pushed.
//!
//! "Flags pushed" is not "releases arrive", and conflating them is the bug this
//! module exists to prevent: Alacritty ≤ 0.14.x is pushed
//! `DISAMBIGUATE_ESCAPE_CODES` without `REPORT_EVENT_TYPES`, so the protocol is
//! live — `Shift+Enter` works, teardown owes a pop — yet no release ever comes,
//! and a hold-to-talk started there could only end on Esc.
//!
//! The gate reads the reported version rather than watching behaviour because
//! there is nothing to watch: a conforming terminal reports no release for these
//! keys either (kitty spec), so healthy and broken differ by one byte per
//! keystroke, gone by the time events are decoded. An earlier design died on it.
//!
//! Deliberately uncovered: [`super::da2`] is skipped under CSI-intercepting
//! multiplexers but [`super::TerminalContext::kitty_skip_reason`] is not, so an
//! affected Alacritty inside tmux ≥ 3.3 answers nothing, keeps
//! `REPORT_EVENT_TYPES` and still double-submits Enter. Downgrading everything
//! that answers nothing would cost far more healthy sessions than that slice.
//!
//! What losing `REPORT_EVENT_TYPES` costs an affected session:
//!
//! - Voice hold-to-talk degrades to a tap toggle (`voice_chord_action`; the
//!   `voice_capture_mode` setting hides its `hold` choice).
//! - `is_link_modifier_for_key`'s non-macOS Ctrl-release case (`xai-grok-pager`
//!   `src/app/agent_view/mod.rs`) never fires, so link-hover clears on the next
//!   non-Ctrl key instead of when Ctrl lifts.
//! - `KeyEventKind::Repeat` disappears: held keys arrive as repeated `Press`, as
//!   on every non-KKP terminal — but `is_pasteable_key_event` (`xai-grok-pager`
//!   `src/app/event_loop.rs`) excludes `Repeat` on purpose, so auto-repeat
//!   counts toward paste coalescing again.
