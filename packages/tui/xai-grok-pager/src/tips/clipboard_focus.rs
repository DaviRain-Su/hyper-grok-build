//! Clipboard-image tip trigger: while the terminal is focused and the active
//! agent is image-eligible, hint that ctrl+v pastes an image sitting on the
//! pasteboard — without waiting for a focus switch.
//!
//! Trigger model: opportunistic, focus-scoped polling. The caller drives
//! [`ClipboardFocusTipState::poll`] only from event-loop iterations that are
//! already running for another reason (input, FocusGained, resize, an animation
//! tick); nothing schedules a wakeup and the tip never forces animation, so an
//! idle/hibernating/unfocused app polls zero times. Each in-window poll is
//! throttled to one cheap `changeCount` read per [`POLL_INTERVAL`], and the
//! heavier type classification runs ONLY on a changeCount delta. Frequency is
//! further capped by a fire cooldown plus a changeCount dedup (the same copied
//! content never re-fires), not a seen-count — the tip is contextual and
//! recurring by design.
//!
//! The state machine takes the clock and BOTH probe steps as inputs, so every
//! transition — including "classify is not called when the changeCount is
//! unchanged" — is unit-testable with a fake clock and call-counting probes.
