//! Cross-platform system clipboard access.
//!
//! On macOS, delegates to `pbcopy`/`pbpaste` subprocesses instead of linking
//! AppKit. This is intentional: the `arboard` crate pulls in `objc2-app-kit`,
//! which causes `dyld` to load `AppKit.framework` at process startup. AppKit
//! unconditionally initialises the Metal/IOAccelerator GPU subsystem, allocating
//! ~2 GB of GPU buffer memory even in headless processes (such as the leader).
//!
//! Using `pbcopy`/`pbpaste` avoids the AppKit link entirely, keeping the leader
//! process free of GPU memory overhead while still providing clipboard support
//! for the TUI.
//!
//! The fast pasteboard probe ([`clipboard_image_snapshot`]) keeps that rule: it
//! reaches `NSPasteboard` via objc2 runtime messaging against a lazily
//! `dlopen`ed AppKit, so no binary links AppKit and processes that never probe
//! never load it. The focus/tick probes only message metadata selectors
//! (`changeCount` / `types`) — never content reads — so they stay
//! sub-millisecond and out of macOS 15.4+ pasteboard privacy alerts.
//!
//! Paste-time image reads ([`get_image`] / [`get_attachments`]) use the same
//! lazily loaded AppKit to read raster bytes in-process (`dataForType:`) on
//! the unambiguous hot path (raster advertised, no file-URL type alongside),
//! skipping the ~0.5–0.9 s `osascript` + temp-file round trip.
//! Content is only ever read at an explicit user paste — the same user-intent
//! boundary where the `osascript`/`pbpaste` subprocesses read the pasteboard —
//! and every other pasteboard shape (file URLs, text→furl coercions, AppKit
//! unavailable, read failure) falls back to the unchanged subprocess path.
//! `GROK_CLIPBOARD_NO_NATIVE_READ=1` disables the in-process read entirely
//! (kill switch if a future macOS gates `dataForType:` behind a prompt).
//!
//! On Linux and Windows, `arboard` is used directly (it does not link AppKit on
//! those platforms).
//!
//! ## OSC 52 (remote clipboard)
//!
//! When running over SSH or inside tmux/screen on a remote host, the native
//! system clipboard (`pbcopy`, `arboard`) writes to the *remote* machine's
//! clipboard, which is invisible to the user. OSC 52 is a terminal escape
//! sequence that tells the user's *local* terminal emulator to set its
//! clipboard, tunnelling through SSH and multiplexers.
//!
//! [`set_text_osc52`] writes an OSC 52 sequence to stderr (the TUI output
//! stream). [`is_remote_session`] detects SSH/tmux/screen environments where
//! OSC 52 should be preferred.
