/// so the leading-run scan stops *before* it and it stays in the live region
/// until the user answers.
///
/// **Lingering-`is_running` agent messages (the "accumulate, don't cap" fix):**
/// the tracker leaves an agent message's `is_running` flag set until turn end —
/// `handle_tool_call` resets `current_agent_msg` to `None` *without* finishing
/// the entry when a tool follows. That stale flag would wedge the frontier at
/// the message, piling the rest of the turn into the fixed-height live tail
/// (which then scrolls/caps). But an agent message that has a *later* block is
/// provably complete (the tracker moved past it and will never append to it
/// again), so we commit it anyway. The commit pass finalizes it before
/// rendering, so it prints in finished form. Only agent messages get this
/// relaxation: a running **tool** may still update its result, so it keeps the
/// strict `is_running` gate, and the **last** entry always stays live.
///
/// **Background-task lifecycle blocks commit even while "running".** A fresh
/// background task is pushed as a `BgTask` "started" block with the entry's
/// `is_running` flag set (`handle_task_backgrounded` → `set_last_running(true)`),
/// but that flag only drives bullet animation — the block's *content* never
/// changes (task completion pushes a **separate** `bg_task_completed`/`failed`
/// block, and live output goes to the task store, not this entry). An async task
/// can outlive its turn, so gating it on `is_running` would wedge the commit
/// frontier for the rest of the turn: the "started" block — and everything after
/// it — would stay stuck in the live tail (scrolled out of view), so the task is
/// invisible until it finishes. Committing it immediately matches design §6.11
/// ("status blocks committed") and keeps the frontier moving.
///
/// Once the turn is **idle** (`turn_running == false`) everything except a
/// pending-user-input block is stable and committable: the tracker can also
/// leave a thinking block's `is_running` flag set after the turn ends (finalize
/// missed at a transition), and that stale flag must not permanently wedge the

/// print in their finished form. The pending-input gate deliberately applies in
