//! Folder-trust gate ("do you trust this folder?").
//!
//! Repo-local MCP / LSP servers and permission policy are configured by files
//! an attacker can ship inside a cloned repository (`.mcp.json`, project
//! `.grok/config.toml` including `[permission]` / `[mcp_servers]` /
//! `[plugins].paths`, `~/.claude.json` `projects.<cwd>`, project `.grok/lsp.json`).
//! Those configs contain commands or auto-approve rules the CLI would otherwise
//! honor automatically — a 1-click RCE / policy bypass. This module resolves a
//! VS-Code-style trust decision ONCE per workspace, BEFORE any repo-local
//! server is spawned, and exposes a cheap [`project_scope_allowed`] check that
//! the MCP/LSP/permission loaders consult.
//!
//! Resolution lives here (not in `acp_session`) so the session core stays free
//! of feature logic; the loaders only call [`project_scope_allowed`].
//!
//! The DECISION side — the workspace scan, the pure [`decide`] precedence, the
//! interactive prompt, and the durable [`xai_grok_workspace::trust::TrustStore`]
//! reads/writes — lives in `xai-grok-workspace` (client-side); this module keeps
//! the CONSUME/gating side (the `DECISIONS` cache, [`resolve_and_record`], and
//! the loader filters). The ordered trust precedence is documented canonically
//! on [`xai_grok_workspace::folder_trust::decide`]; the consume-side nuance is
//! that two allows are PROVISIONAL (NOT cached): the "no repo configs" allow — so
//! configs appearing after the first resolve (git pull / agent write) are
//! re-checked on the next resolve rather than riding a stale grant — and the
//! unrecordable-key allow (cwd is $HOME / fs-root), which can never be persisted
//! anyway (see [`resolve_and_record_inner`] / [`compute`]).
